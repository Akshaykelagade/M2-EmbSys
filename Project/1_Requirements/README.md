# Problem Statement
Implementation of an Automatic Waste Segregator System using Arduino Uno.

# Description
In this project, a cost effective Automated Waste Segregator system for the segregation of waste at the household level is implemented. The proposed segregator system segregates the waste into two types, viz. wet and dry. Here, Arduino Uno board is used as the main controller and various sensors are used to detect each type of waste, which is segregated and thrown into the respective bins. Using this automatic waste segregator system, the separated wastes can be sent directly for recycling.

# High Level Requirements
| Id          |  Description  |    status  |
| :--:        | :--:          |   :--:     |
| HLR1        | The system should segregate the waste into wet and dry      | Implemented |
| HLR2        | The system should display a message when the bin is full    | Implemented |
| HLR3        | The system should open the lid when person come nears to it | Implemented |


# Low Level Requirements

| LLR1        | when sensor detects the waste, servo motor is used to differentiate the waste as wet and dry and dumps the waste into their respective bins | Implemented |
| LLR2        | Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the waste in the bin if the bin is full, then a message is displayed in the LCD                         | Implemented |
| LLR3        | ultrasonic sensor should sense if anyone come close and servo motor should open the door                                                            | Implemented |
