- In this subsystem potemtiometer is used as rain sensor.When sensor value comes less than 5,then servo motor rotates to 180 degrees,dump the waste in wet bin and come backs to normal position. 

# Sub system 2
## Detecting dry waste

- In this subsystem LDR sensor is used to detect the dry waste.When sensor value comes less than 5,then servo motor rotates to 90 degrees,dump the waste in dry bin and come backs to normal position.

# Sub system 3
## Detect a Person and Open the lid

- In this subsystem ultrasonic sensor is used to detect,when a person comes near to the system.If the distance is detected as less the 30 ,then servo motor rotates to 180 degrees,open the lid and close after 2sec and servo motor comes to original position.
